# Bivariate Matrix-Valued Linear Regression (BMLR): Finite-sample performance under Identifiability and Sparsity Assumptions

This repository contains the implementation of algorithms and experiments from our study on **Bivariate Matrix-Valued Linear Regression (BMLR)**. We propose **optimization-free estimators** for matrix-valued linear regression settings, offering theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency.

## Key Features
- **Optimization-Free Estimators**: Implementations of \(\hat{A}\), \(\hat{B}\), \(\hat{A}^S\), and \(\hat{B}^S\).
- **Statistical Analysis**: Non-asymptotic performance bounds validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.
- **Sparse Recovery**: Exact support recovery for sparse parameters with high probability.
- **Numerical Simulations**: Frobenius, operator, and max-norm evaluations with synthetic data.
- **Real-World Applications**: Denoising experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset with noisy transformations.
